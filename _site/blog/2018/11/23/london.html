<p>London has quite a lot of interesting points of interests. I have seen the trafitional monuments and this time I would want to visit less famous places.
Last time I was in London I didnâ€™t have time for Warner Bros. Studio, where Harry Potter was filmed, Sea life, Madame Tussauds and history museum.
This is everything I want to see, but if you write me to jan.hajzok@gmail.com with your recommendations, maybe I will reconsider itinerary.</p>
