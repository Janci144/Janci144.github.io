<p>Rome is a classical place for tourists in summer. September is ideal due to pleasant weather and the acceptable prices due to end of summer holidays. 
I would want to main atractions as well as the less popular places such as Roman catacombs and vatican gardens(yes those gardens). In case you are interest write
me to my email jan.hajzok@gmail.com</p>
