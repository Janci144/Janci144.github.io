My uncle take me to the skialp for the first time in my life. Maybe some of you have not idea what skialp is. For you a little explanation.
Skialp differ from basic skiing in the equipment and especially in skis and ski boots. Skis are lighter than ordinary one build for the slope 
and they have to have mechanism for skialp ski boots. The mechanism enables skier to have free heel and therefore he can move similarly as 
in the cross country skiing and at the way down it is firm so skier
can safely ski down from the mountain.

As first we had climb to Milan Rastislav Štefánik cottage. Our energy has dropped after this ascend and we need to reacharge it, so we stay at
lunch and relax a bit. Our next target was hill call Ďumbier. It was neccesary to go through it because it's on the ridge leading to our destiantion.
At the top of hill is a big metal double cross which symbolize our country. For those who don't know double cross in our nation sign and flag. 
After that we went couple times downhills and uphills until we came to the Chopok hill, our destination, in the altitude of 2048  m a.s.l. Even
thoug it was thick fog and we had see just over 20 metres in distance, it was wonderful feeling.
