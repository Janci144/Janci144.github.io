My uncle take me to the skialp for the first time in my life. Maybe some of you have not idea what skialp is. For you a little explanation.
Skialp differ from basic skiing in the equipment and especially in skis and ski boots. Skis are lighter than ordinary one build for the slope 
and they have to have mechanism for skialp ski boots. The mechanism enables skier to have free heel and therefore he can move similarly as 
in the cross country skiing and at the way down it is firm so skier
can safely ski down from the mountain.
