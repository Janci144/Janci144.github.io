My unckle take me to the skialp for the first time in my life. Skialp differ from basic skiing in the equipment and especially in skis
and ski boots. Skis are lighter than ordinary one build for the slope and they have to have mechanism for skialp ski boots. The mechanism 
enables skier to have free heel and therefore he can move similarly as in the cross country skiing and at the way down it is firm so skier
can safely ski down from the mountain. I had enjoyed it very much.
