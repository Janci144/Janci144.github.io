	The castle origins began in second half of the 14 century and it was meant to be a fortress. It has several
	defence systems such as hudge walland and very convienant place in the middle of the lake. Only way how
	you can get to the castle is on thewooden bridge or at boat. Castle itself has several courtyards where
	are being held Middle Age presentations such as knight fights or market from that era.
