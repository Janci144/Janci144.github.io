		<h1>Hello my name is JÃ¡n Hajzok</h1>
		<p class="margin-bottom200">
			I'm a student of information technology and I have done this web residency
			in my free time. My hobbies are sport, travelling, reading books and of course
			coding. At this site you can find out more about me in various links at the top 
			of the page. If you are searching for employee click on CV,
			if you want to see my blog click on trips and projects. In case that you like 
			travelling click on scheduled trips where you can write me if you are interested
			in one of journeys that I'm planning. I' m always looking for passionate people who like
			trevelling.
